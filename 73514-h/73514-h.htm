<h2 class="nobreak" id="QUO_VADIMUS">QUO VADIMUS?</h2>
</div>


<p>Sitting at my desk by a cosy and
up-to-date gas fire on a foggy day,
with tufts of mist steadily rolling up
from the swollen waters of the wise
old Thames, I try to realize that I am
travelling through space at a rate of
over a thousand miles a minute, on
board a minor planet in forced revolution
round a vast white-hot globe
nearly a hundred million miles away.</p>

<p>Somebody has called astronomy the
Futile Science, and I am not at all
sure that the epithet is wholly
undeserved. What do the stars matter
to us? There was a time when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
were believed to have an influence on
human affairs, particularly those of
kings and emperors. To-day they are
insignificant specks at an immense
distance from us, a distance so great
that if they all were utterly annihilated
neither we nor our remotest descendants
should experience the smallest material
effect.</p>

<p>The only assignable value of the
stars to us, beyond the general enlargement
of our mental horizon, is that
they serve as an accurate measure of
time. But even that use is now almost
superfluous, since other absolute
standards of time have become available,
such as the rates of disintegration
of the radio-active elements.</p>

<p>How, then, can I account for the
fact that there is a perpetual fascination
about “the heavens,” that books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
are constantly being written about
them, societies founded to study them,
and vast observatories built to watch
them?</p>

<p>It cannot be simply the thirst for
knowledge. Knowledge in the abstract
has but few devotees. For every one
person who wants the Truth at all
costs there are a thousand who want
an Illusion at all costs, even at the
cost of mental balance. Let a man go
about proclaiming truths ascertained
by research and experiment, and he
will be considered a bore by all except
a few specialists. But let him boldly
assert an absurdity or a paradox, and
he will obtain millions of adherents,
all animated by the Will to Believe.
And the more absurd his assertions,
the more self-assured and fanatical
will be his followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>No, the popular interest in astronomy
is not due to a thirst for accurate
information. It is due to a vestige of
the old astrological belief in the significance
of the constellations. We still
try to “read our fate in the stars.”
They are of interest to us for what
they can tell us of the future, proximate
or remote. We search the heavens
for an answer to the question
“Whither?”—<i lang="la">Quo vadimus?</i></p>

<p>In trying to predict the fate of the
human race we must begin by gauging
the chances of permanence possessed
by our habitable globe. Its probable
age has been put at a hundred million
years. Predictions as to when it will
cease to be habitable vary enormously,
but the latest figures go into many
millions of years, and the discovery of
radio-activity has had the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
greatly postponing the general freezing
up of our planet.</p>

<p>Our earthly habitation, then, seems
assured for many millions of years.
But millions of years are, after all,
but relative, and they vanish before
the vast age of the stellar universe<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and the enormous vistas of time yet
to come.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Dr. Jeans, on very modern data, puts this age
at seven million million years.</p>

</div>

<p>How far can our gaze penetrate the
fog which obscures our future? Can
we build for eternity? Must we prepare
for a catastrophe or an inevitable
decay? Can we assure to our descendants
an indefinitely prolonged future
of perpetual progress and ever-increasing
happiness?</p>

<p>The answer to these questions is
ultimately based upon psychological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
factors. Human life requires certain
physical conditions for its maintenance.
It also requires the passive assistance
of many forms of animal life and plant
life. But Man is, without exception,
the most adaptable inhabitant of this
globe, and there is little fear of any
physical or biological factors bringing
about his extinction, provided they
change sufficiently gradually. If life
is adaptation to surroundings, then
Man has more chance of surviving
changing conditions than any other
form of terrestrial life. What other
species can thrive equally in the Arctic
and under the Equator? The dog is
man’s only rival in that respect, and
is but second best.</p>

<p>We need, therefore, not be anxious
lest a change in general physical
environment bring our race to an end.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
The end of the human race, if ever it
comes, will be due to the human race
itself. If the race dies, it will die by
suicide. And suicide is a matter of
psychology.</p>

<p>Let us examine the possibility of a
voluntary euthanasia of the human
race. It seems the only sort of suicide
that is at all conceivable. Can we
imagine a state of things arising in
which the leaders will say: “We have
lived long enough. Our race has had a
glorious history, let it have a glorious
end. We cannot and will not bow to
the new conditions imposed by Nature.
We would rather die and end it all.
Let us all perish together.”</p>

<p>Such an attitude would indeed be a
new phenomenon. People have died
rather than surrender, but it was with
the thought of the approval of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
fellows and the perpetual honour of
their names. In the case contemplated
there would be no such inducement to
heroism. The surrender would be
unchronicled and unsung.</p>

<p>A refusal to adapt itself to new
conditions is not unknown among
savage races, nor among classes of
civilized society. Tribes have perished
off the face of the earth, owing to a
voluntary refusal or to inability to
adapt themselves to new conditions of
life. But, so far as we know, this has
always taken place in the presence of
races of superior adaptability.</p>

<p>Civilizations have perished. We do
not know, of course, how many civilizations
have disappeared without leaving
a trace. But we do know that races
have existed, even in our own islands,
who were capable of transporting and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
building up great pieces of rock, and of
arranging them in an astronomically
significant manner. Did these races
perish under the attacks of an enemy?
Or did they die off owing to the exhaustion
of their own vitality? We may
suppose that it was the former rather
than the latter alternative. For in
view of the great and increasing power
of the human race we hardly need
fear any enemies from without. Our
destruction, if ever it comes, will come
from within. It will come if and when
we develop a Will to Die.</p>

<p>Such a Will to Die has been observed
on a small scale in the wave of suicide
sweeping over Central Europe after
the Great War. But it was only a
symptom of readjustment. It was
partial, and practically confined to the
class bound up with social and governmental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
stability, and incapable of
adaptation to radically changed conditions.</p>

<p>A more ominous phenomenon is the
fall in the birth-rate of most of the
insular tribes of the Pacific, which in
some cases has led to their total extinction.
The causes of this fall have
never been fully cleared up. If it is
due to the introduction of diseases by
Indo-European germ carriers, or the
adoption of modern clothing, or the
destruction of native standards of
morality by the introduction of Asiatic
religions, there is no cause for alarm
concerning the future of the human
race as a whole. But if the mere
discouragement of the tribe when faced
with new conditions can act directly
upon the instinct of procreation, and
affect, so to speak, the <i lang="fr">élan vital</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the germ-plasm, then we are faced
with the gravest danger to which the
human race can be exposed.</p>

<p>For such an effect would be too
insidious to be dealt with by public
measures. It would be a psychological
disease of the most fatal and virulent
kind. It might affect the whole human
race during some crisis in its fortunes,
and might bring about its destruction
by the failure of the sex instinct.</p>

<p>Although such a failure must always
be a menacing possibility, it is a remote
one, and at no time has it threatened
the human race as a whole. Hunger
and Love have kept our race going up
to now, and, barring unforeseen
developments, they will do so <i lang="la">in sœcula
sœculorum</i>.</p>

<p>But there are other dangers. A new
germ might be evolved which, like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
gonococcus, might attack the germ
plasm, and produce general sterility.
This is one of the dangers that <em>can</em> be
fought by hygienic and sanitary
measures, and the wiles and intricacies
of bacteriological novelties may be
safely left to the ever-increasing
resources of bacteriology itself.</p>

<p>Again, there is the danger of new
“rays.” It is now a well-known fact
that X-rays produce sterility when
penetrating the human body in considerable
strength or for any length of
time. The effect can be guarded against
by an armour of lead screens. X-rays
are cut off by a thin sheet of lead.
There are other rays, known as gamma-rays,
which can penetrate several inches
of lead. And higher up in the atmosphere,
about seven miles up, another
kind of radiation is found from which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
even a plate of lead five feet thick
would be no protection. If the sun,
entering an unknown part of space
filled with denser matter, were to
develop a form of radiation leading to
a considerable increase in the penetrating
atmospheric rays, the persistent
action of these rays upon the human
germ plasm might bring about the
total destruction of the human race by
reducing its birth-rate to zero. The
effect might not even be discovered
until it was too late to remedy it. And
even if it were discovered in time, the
action of the rays upon all life on the
earth’s surface might have produced
havoc enough to stop all food-supplies
and produce universal starvation.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see how even the
greatest resources of science could
meet such an emergency as that. But,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
short of such a new danger, there is
little doubt that the resources of
humanity will be able to meet all conceivable
situations which may threaten
it with destruction.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the indefinite
continuance of the human race on
earth, it is necessary</p>

<p>(1) to maintain adequate food
supplies and (2) to conserve the procreative
impulse.</p>

<p>The latter condition might, indeed,
be put first on the list.</p>

<p>These are the conditions of bare
existence. Progress and happiness are,
as they always have been, secondary
considerations. Many minds have
regarded one or both of them as
unessential. Thus, it is not at all
necessary to contemplate an <em>increasing</em>
population of the globe. The leadership<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
of the human race can much more
effectively be maintained by educating
individuals than by increasing their
numbers. And as regards happiness,
that can safely be left to take care of
itself. All progress is progress towards
greater happiness. Even mere existence
can be a source of supreme happiness,
as when a great danger has been
successfully averted.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Once we are sure that the human
race has a reasonable chance of indefinite
survival, we can proceed to contemplate
the changes, if any, which are
likely to take place as the centuries and
millennia roll on.</p>

<p>Anthropologists put the age of the
human race roughly at half a million
years. In that comparatively long
period—long as compared with history,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
but short as reckoned by geology—man
has evolved from an ape-like,
tree-dwelling nut-eater into a plodding,
illiterate, monosyllabic tiller of the soil,
(I take the majority of mankind as
representative of its state of progress
rather than the <i lang="fr">élite</i>). The 500 millennia
of human evolution have had but
little effect on the human form and the
average human character. The brain
is somewhat larger generally and the
mouth rather less protruding. The
mental equipment of the representative
man—the man representing the
majority—is in many ways inferior to
that of the dog or the ant. He is
full of greeds and lusts and superstitions
which place him on a level with
the higher animal life, or even below it.</p>

<p>It is in his possibilities rather than
in his actual state of development that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
man is a superior being. Those possibilities
have to some extent been
realized in the educated few. When
we speak of civilization, of modern life
and scientific advance, we fix our
attention exclusively on the educated
<i lang="fr">élite</i>. In asserting, for instance, that
nowadays nobody doubts that the
earth is round, we are referring to a
very small minority of the human race,
composed of perhaps half the adults of
Europe and America and Australia,
with a small sprinkling of Africans and
Asiatics, in all perhaps 10 per cent. of
the total population. If a vote were
taken of every man, woman, and child
in the world to decide whether the
earth is flat or round, there would be a
majority of perhaps 9 to 1 in favour of
a flat earth.</p>

<p>Again, “everybody” is supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
know that a whale is not a fish, that it
does not spawn or lay eggs, but that
it suckles its young like any other
mammalian. What proportion of the
human race actually <em>does</em> know that
simple fact? How many human beings
even know that the sun is larger than
the moon? A great many, no doubt,
but how many out of the whole race?</p>

<p>Scientific knowledge is the birthright
of every human child. But on that
very account, perhaps, it is neither
prized nor cherished. In the markets
where thoughts are bought and sold,
an ounce of illusion is worth a ton of
fact.</p>

<p>The enormous disproportion between
the amount of knowledge accumulated
by the human intelligentsia and the
general level of knowledge is productive
of many evils and anomalies. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
necessarily breeds an attitude of contemptuous
superiority towards the
uninformed masses, and supplies a
temptation to profit by that superiority
in order to dominate and oppress the
majority. Many wars, strikes, revolutions,
and other social crises are the
outcome of this anomalous condition.
On the other hand, the very existence
of empires requires the presence of a
great substratum of the half-educated
or uncultivated to follow the lead and
obey the behests of the Imperial few.</p>

<p>The British Empire derives its
strength from the numerical strength
of its <i lang="fr">élite</i>. The Russian Empire and
its direct heir, the present Oligarchy,
have had a small <i lang="fr">élite</i> raised above an
enormous mass of what is probably the
least-educated population in the world,
outside Africa. The French African<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Empire disguises the hegemony of
Paris under the liberal concession of a
nominal French citizenship to its subject
tribes. The French <i lang="fr">élite</i> is broader
than the British, as wealth in France is
more evenly distributed. In Germany,
on the other hand, and in certain
smaller countries, like Denmark and
Finland, it is education rather than
wealth which is more or less impartially
distributed. This also tends to broaden
the <i lang="fr">élite</i> and make the nation (as distinguished
from the empire) more
intrinsically powerful.</p>

<p>We thus get an <i lang="fr">élite</i> among nations
as well as individuals. This <i lang="fr">élite</i> is,
however, based upon force rather than
intellectual leadership, owing to the
fact that a nation regarded as an
organism is in a much more primitive
stage of evolution than is a civilized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
individual. Nations have no morality,
no curbs upon their greed, their hatred,
their jealousy and vindictiveness.</p>

<p>The rivalry among nations makes for
progress, but its most active manifestations
may produce a serious set-back
of long duration, involving irreparable
loss.</p>

<p>So long as peace and goodwill do
not prevail among individual men it
is absurd to expect them to prevail
among a collection of beasts of prey
such as we have in the nations of the
world. Yet it is obviously desirable
that the human population of the globe
should advance as one man. There is
one thing, and one thing only, which
can unite humanity into one closely-knit
organism, and that is <em>an external
enemy</em>.</p>

<p>If Mr. H. G. Wells’s <cite>War of the</cite><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
<cite>Worlds</cite> were to come true, and an
expeditionary force of Martians were
to land on the earth with a view to its
annexation, then the human race might
instantly unite to repel the invader. It
would be an inspiring sight to see Japanese
and Turks, Abyssinians and Zulus,
Eskimos and Swiss, Brazilians and
Mexicans and Doughboys, Tahitians
and Britishers and Russians, Irish and
Egyptians, Persians and Chinese, all
vying with each other in devotion and
bravery, fighting for their native planet
against a ruthless and merciless invader.</p>

<p>Without such a danger from without,
the close federation of the nations of
the world is almost unthinkable. Take
the case of Ireland. There we have two
nationalities in one island, as opposed
to each other as any two nations in the
same continent. In the North, a hardy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
stern, rough and unbending type of
Scottish origin, who despises the
“natives” of Ireland as an inferior
race, and makes good by converting a
large slice of the “distressful country”
into a garden of prosperity. In the
South, a graceful and indolent peasant
race, with all the mingled diffidence and
bravado of a conquered people largely
pervaded by the blood of its conquerors,
and imbued with the idea of martyrdom
for the twin ideas of religion and
nationality (in this case, as it happens,
quite incompatible). How can anyone
expect peace under such conditions?
The situation is the very stuff that
ruthless wars are made of. The
Ulsterman will not “go under” a
Dublin parliament run by what he
considers to be ignorant cornerboys.
The Munsterman looks upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
“blaack Praatestant” of the North
as dirt, which Ireland must disgorge
before she can rise to the height of her
destiny. England, with her good-natured
religious and ethnical tolerance,
is despised by both parties, though
the Ulsterman clings passionately to
the empire, which he provides with the
largest ships afloat.</p>

<p>That sort of thing makes international
tribunals and Leagues of Nations
look ridiculous. Here are two populations
in a small island, ready to rend
each other limb from limb on the
slightest excuse because the country is
not large enough to hold both.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is an undoubted
fact that international trade, finance,
and intercourse has increased enormously
with improved means of transport.
The Postal Union is a fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
achievement towards the unification of
the whole human family. Its successful
working shows that enterprises
covering the entire civilized population
of the globe can now be undertaken
and carried through. It so happens
that the two greatest States of the
world, the British Empire and the
United States of America, are also the
States whose home countries are freest
from national intolerance and race
prejudice, both consisting of a mixture
of many nationalities. It is to them,
as well as France, that we must look
for the greatest advances towards the
ideal of a world federation. Germany
before the War cherished dreams of
World Supremacy, but lacked the
schooling which might have led to
success.</p>

<p>The two great Empires—British and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Japanese—and the two great Republics—France
and U.S.A.—will, if they can
agree, form a good nucleus for a
federation of the world. The world,
in its present state, requires leadership,
and if the leaders are a representative
and benevolent oligarchy, it is about
the best we can hope for.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Given a reasonable degree of stability,
guaranteed by a combination of the
best instruments of government yet
devised, we may expect a very rapid
progress. What direction will this
progress take, and what will be the
fruits of it?</p>

<p>Do not listen to those futile people
who say there is no progress, and that
there is “nothing new under the sun”!
So far from maintaining that what is
has been and ever shall be I should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
assert that nothing that is has ever
been before, that there are new things
evolved every day, and that every child
born is a unique personality, unprecedented
in the annals of creation.</p>

<p>And not only are things new, but the
new things are, on the general average,
a bit more advanced than the last.
Advanced towards what? Towards
perfection, towards greater happiness,
a fuller and more enduring life.</p>

<p>Who will dare deny that life in
England—to take the nearest example—is
happier now than it was even fifty
years ago? Some people will sigh for
the good old times of the Victorian
reign, when money and employment
were plentiful, when there was ample
leisure for the rich, with pleasant ways
of spending it, when masters were
masters indeed and servants were loyal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
respectful, and dutiful. But in recent
times, apart from the tragedy of the
Great War, there has been an immense
improvement in the life of the average
Englishman and his dependents. The
general level of education has risen,
infectious diseases have been successfully
fought, schooling has become
brighter and more effective, clothing has
become more rational. There is more
fresh air and less drudgery. The workman
draws a larger share of the product
of his effort, and often drives his
motor car while his employer goes by
train. The workman draws his bloated
wage under the protection of his trade
union, while the employer lies awake at
night wondering how best to keep the
works running and find new markets
for old. That is nearly all to the good,
since there are many more workmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
than employers, and the general level
of contentment is raised.</p>

<p>Even the aged, instead of being
thrown on the scrap heap, are guarded
from destitution by pensions honourably
drawn from a wise government.</p>

<p>It will, I hope, be put to my credit
that I have not carolled the blessings
of the cinema theatre or even of wireless
broadcasting. The optimist who
emphasizes these is usually met with
the reply that these do more harm
than good, and spoil young people for
ordinary life. Whatever may be said
concerning the dull hotch-potch turned
out “in bulk” by the American film
industry, nobody can deny that an
element of romance has been brought
into the lives of countless poor people
by Edison’s and Berliner’s great invention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>As regards wireless broadcasting, it
is too early to speak of its permanent
effects. It has come upon us like an
avalanche. For the first time, it has
enlisted youth in the highest electrical
problems. It has paved the way for
the general diffusion of scientific knowledge
while ostensibly popularizing the
art of music. In any case, it is a
complete answer to Ben Akiba and his
saying about there being nothing new.</p>

<p>Mr. J. B. S. Haldane<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> believes that
the centre of scientific interest now lies
in biology, and that physiology will
eventually invade and destroy mathematical
physics. It is quite possible
that the advance of what physicists
sometimes playfully call the “inexact”
sciences may cast those of physics and
chemistry entirely in the shade, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
although biology has made some difference
to human life in the last generation,
its effects cannot remotely compare
with those of physical and chemical
discoveries. The mere increase of
speed in transport, due to the internal-combustion
engine, has caused a speeding-up
of the whole nervous system
and a brightening of the intelligence of
all but an insignificant fraction of the
population. When the choice lies between
the Quick and the Dead, even
the most sluggish temperament will
put on a spurt, and this continued
sprinting across the motor traffic has
produced a more agile generation. If
such a profound difference can be made
in twenty years, what will be the effect
of even 200 years of continually accelerated
progress?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> <cite>Dædalus</cite>, pp. 10 and 16.</p>

</div>

<p>The continual acceleration of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
rate of progress must not be lost sight
of in forecasting the future. It happens
to coincide with a similar increase
in the consumption of accumulated
fuels, like coal and oil, and might be
expected to slow down when those supplies
of preserved sunlight come to an
end. But by that time other accumulations
will no doubt have been discovered
and utilized.</p>

<p>Unless the Russian blight extends
over Europe and America, we may
confidently look forward to a long era
of steadily accelerated progress. What
form that progress will take is notoriously
difficult to forecast. The main
difficulty arises from the fact that the
most promising discoveries sometimes
turn out to be impracticable, or at
least of quite secondary importance.
Nobody prophesied the great development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of the motor car, nor of that
gigantic child of the old Zoetrope or
“Wheel of Life” which we call the
Picture Theatre. A genius like H. G.
Wells could indeed write a marvellously
accurate forecast of flying
achievements, but in one of his books
he makes a great deal of the Brennan
mono-rail, which, after a sensational
beginning, failed to reach maturity,
probably owing to the temporary failure
of that much-maligned but quite
essential fertilizer of inventions, capital.
Other inventions, such as the
speaking film, bear within themselves
certain weaknesses which may prevent
them from attaining great popularity.</p>

<p>But previous failures to peep into
the future effectively shall not deter
the author from another attempt to
pierce the veil hiding our fate. He will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
proceed by “extrapolating” the curves
representing progress made hitherto,
but will always allow for unexpected
new departures in what are already
known to be possible directions.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Transport and Communications.</i>—The
most conspicuous changes in our
mode of life have been brought about
by improved means of transport. Railways
and steamships have become essential
to Great Britain, largely owing
to the fact that food-supplies have to
be purchased in exchange for exported
manufactures. But even in non-industrial
countries the railway has
entered very largely into the life of
the people. It is part of the essential
attribute of life which seeks diversity
and a fuller activity of the senses. Life
is, in effect, prolonged when it is made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
to contain more and more detail.
The social life of a person is roughly
measured by the number of people
with whom he converses in the course
of a day. Improved transport means
facilities for extending this number.
It also means an enlargement of a person’s
sphere of influence, of his “area
of effective occupation.” In business,
it gives an opportunity of increasing
turnover, and thus reducing costs. It
also facilitates competition, both in
buying and selling, and thus tends to
enforce the law of supply and demand
and other enactments of what used to
be called the “dismal science,” but
now ranks as the most “actual” of
all the sciences.</p>

<p>Postal and telegraphic facilities have
the same general effect of diversifying
and extending life. The telephone has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
produced an entirely new form of
social intercourse, and a new privileged
class. By acquiring a telephone number,
we obtain entrance into a hall
where rapid and varied communication
becomes an abundant source of activity,
information, and amusement.</p>

<p>Increased facilities of this kind also
tend to cement a nation of one language
into a closely organized whole,
so that its cohesion and its influence
abroad are strengthened. The “temperature”
of the national life is raised,
and it increases in proportion. An increased
energy also accelerates the rate
of progress, so that it tends to spread
like a fire. What this acceleration will
mean we can as yet only dimly surmise.
A time will come, no doubt, when we
may crowd into an hour a variety of
experiences which our ancestors would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
have extended over a lifetime. We
need not necessarily do so, but the
mere fact that it is possible will add a
zest and a richness to life such as we,
with all our advantages, can as yet
hardly conceive. But the general effect
will be to reduce more and more the
limitations now imposed upon us by
space. It will no doubt be eventually
possible to get into communication with
anybody on earth at a moment’s notice,
provided that person is willing.</p>

<p><i>Privacy.</i>—The last proviso is important.
Civilization not only makes us
more accessible to those we appreciate,
but also makes us less accessible to
those of whom we disapprove. An increase
in our area of choice would be
of little value if everybody else could
choose to intrude upon us at any time
or place. A limitation of social intercourse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
to a chosen few, or its total
cessation for the time required for rest
and recuperation in a strenuous life is
one of the greatest boons one can desire.
The rank and file is more gregarious
than the <i lang="fr">élite</i> and, as one of the ideals
of progress is to raise the masses
towards the level occupied by the <i lang="fr">élite</i>,
the extension of facilities for seclusion
is of the essence of progress. Hence
commons and open spaces are provided
in and around well-planned cities.
Houses are provided with sound-proof
walls, and gardens are protected as
much as possible from “overlooking.”
A very modern problem of the same
kind is the protection of wireless listeners
from oscillations produced in neighbouring
receiving sets.</p>

<p><i>Clothing.</i>—The present generation
of civilized humanity justly prides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
itself on its sensible style of clothing.
Although masculine clothing contains
a number of “vestigial” elements
which are absurd survivals of former
necessities, the practice, observed more
especially in Great Britain, of wearing
a variety of apparel suited to special
occasions and occupations adds a certain
elasticity to fashions which otherwise
are almost comically rigid. If a man
wore a wreath of flowers round his head
instead of a hat he would not walk fifty
yards in any London street without
being arrested for “insulting behaviour”
or “conduct likely to cause
a breach of the peace.” Yet a woman
could do so with impunity if she did it
with the necessary air of assurance.</p>

<p>The future of clothing is largely
affected by social problems. Masculine
clothing ceased to be demonstrative in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Europe shortly after the French
Revolution. While aristocracy flourished,
it paraded itself aggressively in
velvet and ruffles and powdered wigs.
In modern times it is bad form to
strut and swagger, except on very
special occasions. Good clothing is
not aggressively ornate or expensive.
Its quality is a matter of lines and cut
and finish. Its preciousness is disguised
from the uninitiated. It is like the
sober and almost dingy town houses of
the nobility, whose splendour is only
shown to favoured friends and trusted
servants. In 1794 the dress of the
“aristo” was a passport to the guillotine.
In later and wiser days it is a
disguise to deceive the tax-collector and
the demagogue, and to lull their prying
rapacity into inactivity.</p>

<p>Feminine attire follows the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
principles, modified by the essential
differences between the sexes. The
ideal of a well-dressed woman varies
widely with her surroundings. In bad
weather out of doors, or in an unsympathetic
crowd, her garments will be a
defensive armour designed to reveal as
little of her personality as is compatible
with her purpose. Under more favourable
conditions, they will become a
setting made as suitable as possible to
the peculiar qualities and attractions
of the jewel they are supposed to contain.
Not every woman can, under
present conditions, be beautiful, but
she can suggest beauty at every turn,
remind us of beautiful things, and give
us that feeling of holy calm which we
experience in the presence of beauty,
if she will but dress appropriately to
the occasion and to her own personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>These considerations must affect our
view of the appropriate styles of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
2025. Dress appropriate to the occasion!
Dress is, after all, a sort of
extension of the physical personality.
The body of a naked child at play is
the most perfect thing in beauty that
can be seen. All its muscles adapt
themselves instantly to its activities.
Everything is appropriate and harmonious.
A thin and clinging covering
would detract but little from its grace
of movement and expression, and
might, indeed, add something of force
and swiftness that cannot be perceived
in the mere play of muscles. Thus the
plumes of a Red Indian add to the
sense of speed and purpose conveyed
by his movements.</p>

<p>I do not agree with Mr. H. G. Wells
that the final ideal of clothing is its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
total abolition. Clothing has the effect
of enlarging man’s sphere of activity
until it covers the entire globe from the
poles to the equator. Another advantage
is that it emphasizes mental
qualities rather than physical qualities.
If mere physical beauty were the one
essential to human well-being, mankind
would have long ago insisted on its
being freely displayed—and judged—without
the disguise of clothing.</p>

<p>Instead, a common agreement
among civilized peoples insists that on
everyday occasions little but the face
is to be visible, because its features
and expression give a clue to the
mentality behind them. On special
occasions, such as balls and dinner
parties, more may be revealed by the
gentler sex, but even then the area
revealed must be confined to what is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
least likely to show defects and is of
least physiological interest and importance,
so that the attention may still
be directed towards mental rather than
emotional or physical qualities.</p>

<p>The evolution of clothing will, therefore,
be in the direction of adaptability
to climate and occupation. New fabrics
will no doubt be invented, combining
the warmth of fur with the softness
and flexibility of silk and the strength
of linen. Dress will be light, so that
half a dozen changes of costume can
be carried in a handbag, and will be so
designed that each change will involve
no more inconvenience than does the
removal of a raincoat. And so we
shall eventually combine the Greek
ideal of expressive drapery with the
exacting conditions of a strenuous
modern life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p><i>Housing.</i>—Man is an animal with a
cubical shell. If the earth were reduced
to the size of a football and its surface
were examined with a powerful microscope,
we should see it studded with
incrustations like dried salt, especially
about the river mouths. These incrustations
would be the cities, consisting of
thousands of rectangular or cube-shaped
blocks. With a greater magnification
we might see minute specks swarming
about these shell-like houses, elongated
specks with their longer axis vertical,
and with a marked tendency to enter
the houses at nightfall and emerge
again after daybreak.</p>

<p>If a giant had been watching the
development of these incrustations for
several thousand years, he would have
seen them spreading from the Mediterranean
and some parts of Asia till they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
studded the Atlantic regions. Thence,
after a time, they would spread to the
other side of the Atlantic, and become
particularly numerous along its western
shores. Watching them again for
several thousand years, he might see
these incrustations gradually dissolved,
and the disease—he would probably call
it a disease—become “generalized”
all over the planet, the local incrustations
giving way before a universal
but only slightly crusted condition of
the earth’s entire land surface.</p>

<p>This is the most probable solution
of the general housing problem. Ordinary
and wireless telephony, soon to
be supplemented by “television,” will
gradually reduce the isolation brought
about by mere space, while underground
and overground transport of
goods will render the distribution of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
supplies less and less laborious. Houses
will, therefore, be built more widely
apart than they are in cities, and each
will have its own private grounds. The
structures will be of a material impervious
to heat and cold, but transparent
or translucent to light, though there
will be means of darkening the whole
house if desired. Artificial lighting
will not be by lamps, but by a close
imitation of diffused daylight, which is
coolest and most restful to the eyes.
There will be no domestic servants.
All the “work” of the house will be
done by machinery requiring but the
turning of a switch and the aiming of
implements resembling magic wands.
Cooking will be a pleasant domestic
art, most of the preparations being
made by the purveyors of food stuffs.
As it is unlikely that the anatomical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
structure and the physiological functioning
of the human frame will be
materially changed for thousands of
years to come, food will not be very
different from what it is now, but there
will be a nicer discrimination of what
foods, and what quantity of them, are
best calculated to maintain perfect
health.</p>

<p><i>Children.</i>—Most prophets concerning
the future of the human race postulate
many and radical changes in the
birth and rearing of children. Some
say that advancing civilization will
make the present process impossible on
account of the steadily increasing size
of the human skull, which will eventually
make normal birth impossible.
Professor Haldane forecasts “ectogenesis”
or the artificial ripening of
the embryo outside the human body.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Whatever may happen to the physical
act of birth—it will no doubt be
alleviated in many ways—one hopes
that the tender joys of watching over
the development of a child’s body
and mind will not be taken away
from us.</p>

<p>Much more enlightened care will, no
doubt, be bestowed upon the welfare
of the infant than is done at present.
How many crimes are unwittingly
committed against a child’s mentality
by ignorant parents and nurses! Lies
and prevarications and evasions are
always reprehensible, but with children
they are of fatal and life-long effect.
We owe the truth to a child more than
to any adult. Our promises to a child
should be as binding as an oath. Tell
them fairy tales by all means, but
tell them with a voice and expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
which inevitably stamps them as such,
and makes belief optional.</p>

<p>I cannot see any effective substitute
for family life so long as there are
children to bring up. Children feed on
love as they do on food and fresh air,
and no vicarious love can take the
place of the natural affection between
children and their parents. The
institution of marriage may undergo
many and far-reaching changes<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, but
nothing is likely to change the paramount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
necessity of parental care of,
and responsibility for, children.
Children are rooted in their parents.
They are, in a sense, survivals of their
parents’ personality, and constitute
their chance of physical immortality.
It is, therefore, absurd to suppose that
the human race will at any time in its
history consent to the “nationalization”
of its children. On the other
hand, the supervision of ill-disposed or
incompetent parents by the State will,
no doubt, become more and more strict.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Its early history shows it to be a contrivance
for the safe-guarding of infants in their
earliest years by allocating a large proportion
of responsibility to the father. Among Semitic
and other Asiatic tribes, this allocation of
responsibility was fortified by the somewhat
crude precaution of secluding women. Marriage
as a means of allocating responsibility will
become superfluous as soon as parentage can be
infallibly traced with the aid of the microscope,
as some biologists confidently foretell. The
chief <i lang="fr">raison d’etre</i> of marriage will then be gone,
but it will no doubt continue for a considerable
time as a picturesque survival of an ancient
custom.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Education.</i>—In spite of the prodigious
advance in educational methods in the
last two generations, education is still
in a state of primitive barbarity. We
may, therefore, expect some very profound
changes in the centuries to come.
There is still too much of the methods
of the pump about our education.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
The idea seems to be that the teacher
draws from the well of knowledge and
administers copious draughts to his
pupils, and when they have swallowed
these they are educated! There is no
better illustration of this curious view
than the modern method of imparting
“higher” education. The University
lecture is, of all methods of imparting
knowledge, about the least effective.
The student sits in a stiff attitude and
maintains a pose of strained attention.
He endeavours to keep his mind concentrated
on the words and meaning
of the professor. Every now and then
he succeeds, but then his thoughts
persist in following their own train of
associations and the thread is broken.
He jots down disconnected notes, hoping
to piece them together afterwards.
This piecing together is often the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
process which really advances his knowledge.
It brings his own will-power
and faculties into action. The lecture
only requires will-power for concentration
on somebody else’s thought, and
this effort is negative and sterile.</p>

<p>If lectures must be, then they should
be interrupted after every ten minutes
or so. The lecturer should then sit
down and invite and encourage his
students to ask pertinent questions or
advance sound criticism.</p>

<p>In a class-room it is easier to keep
the interest of the pupils alive. Every
effort should be made to let the information
come from the pupils rather
than the teacher. In teaching history,
for instance, I should not have set lessons
at all, but ask the pupils to collect
facts within a certain period, and reward
them in accordance with their success<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
in presenting the facts and linking
them up with others.</p>

<p>The education of the future will be
like the medicine of the future. Both
will aim at eliciting and enlisting the
powers of the pupil (or patient) rather
than dosing them. For the real learning
and the real cure must come from them.</p>

<p>Every normal child is anxious to
learn, and can be easily brought to
feel and appreciate the intellectual
joy of comprehension. But in most
children this joy is marred in early
infancy by insufficient attention to
their struggles to understand the great
world about them. It is the years of
infancy—the pre-school years—which
are most important in forming habits
of thought. The closest watch should
be kept for early efforts at trains of
reasoning. These efforts begin at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
age of three or thereabouts. They are
often absurd and ludicrous, but they
should be treated with an indulgent
and helpful respect, and wrong conclusions
should be modified, not by
contradiction, but by conviction of
the contrary by example. If that is
done, the child will learn to trust his
own powers of reasoning. If it is
neglected, the child’s mind will become
shallow and unenterprising.</p>

<p>No child that can talk is too young
to be asked for his opinion. He will
enjoy stating it, and will, as a rule,
receive protests or contrary opinions
with interest and amusement.</p>

<p>All this may be a “counsel of
perfection” to parents who are too
busy to look after their infants themselves
and are content to entrust their
tender minds to more or less incompetent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
nurses. But the future will realize
more and more the great importance of
the growing minds of infants. In the
United States this is to a large extent
the case already, and, as a consequence,
their infants are the brightest and most
delightful creatures imaginable.</p>

<p><i>Labour.</i>—In one of his earliest works,
“The Time Machine,” Mr. H. G.
Wells forecasts a development of the
labour situation very different from
that of the ordinary socialist Utopia.
He figures an arrangement by which
all labour is done underground, and is
done by creatures (one can hardly call
them “people”) whose bodies and
minds are thoroughly adapted to their
task. The picture seems to be a skit
on the Victorian idea of the “family”
upstairs and the servants in the basement,
but a grim and novel touch is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
added by the information that the
workers actually live on those that
dwell in the light, coming up at night
to take them away in their sleep.</p>

<p>Such a solution, though it may draw
some justification from the bee-hive or
the ant-heap, is not at all likely to be
adopted by the human race of the
future. The essential service of Christianity,
the kernel which will remain
after the mythological and dogmatic
accretions have been shed, is to provide
mankind with an imagination capable
of conceiving and realizing the sufferings
of other people and creatures, and
the will to remedy or obviate them as
far as possible. Through centuries of
abuse, neglect and misinterpretation
that gift has gradually worked into
the mass of civilized humanity. The
humanitarian ideal is explicit and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
articulate in France, while in England
it is disguised under such expressions
as “decency” and “playing the
game,” or “live and let live.”</p>

<p>That it has not yet remade the world
is due mainly to two causes: the
arrogance of those to whom money or
social position gives an advantage over
smaller people, and the hatred and
mistrust engendered by this arrogance
among the masses.</p>

<p>A workman in a physically fit condition
does not object to working. He
sometimes feels the drudgery, boredom,
or discomfort of it, but if he is a
skilled craftsman, his pride in his work
gives him an interest and satisfaction
which helps him over many hours of
toil. What he does object to is to be
driven and bullied by an unsympathetic
and perhaps unjust overseer, who turns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
out the master on every occasion and
lets him feel his power. He wants
and sometimes admires a leader, but
he does not want a slave-driver.</p>

<p>In war, there is the same difference
between the “come on” officer and the
“go-on” officer, and the same effect
on discipline.</p>

<p>I believe that the co-operation of
larger organized masses of men will not
only be required in the future as in the
past, but that its scale will eventually
exceed anything yet seen in our history.</p>

<p>The key to the smooth working of
such organizations is the spirit in which
the enterprise is undertaken. Let us
give two examples, one from the present
day and one from, say, the year 2,000.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">(1) <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1925:</p>

<p class="p2 noi">(2) <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 2000:</p>

<p class="hang">Norfolk Water Supply Undertaking. A public
meeting will be held on ... at
the Norwich Auditorium, to announce
and explain the purpose and plan of this
Undertaking. Workers and Contributors
will be enlisted on terms to be
announced at this meeting. Qualification
papers may be sent to the undersigned....</p>
</div>

<p>It is obvious that the “contributor”
who places his savings at the disposal
of the Undertaking must not only not
lose them thereby, but must be compensated
according to the risk he runs.
In effect, he provides the manual
worker with the food he requires to
exert his strength, and he does so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
without any immediate benefit to himself.
If, after the Undertaking had
got to work, his “contribution” were
simply refunded, he would receive no
reward for his public service, a service
which implied a reduction in his own
resources. This would be unjust and
would make his treatment worse than
that of the wage-earner.</p>

<p>To this simple plea a Communist
would rejoin that nobody should be
allowed to have savings or accumulated
resources or private property of any
kind. The absurdity of this contention
is very easily demonstrated, but
let us add a few hard cases to the usual
arguments:—</p>

<p>(1) A tribe of shepherds requires
water. There is one man who
knows the location of a well. His
knowledge is his private property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
which he offers to sell for a number
of cows. What should be done, if the
man is (a) accessible and undefended;
(b) inaccessible.</p>

<p>(2) A girl has a beautiful head of
hair, which could be sold abroad for a
considerable sum. Whose property is
it?</p>

<p>(3) In a small and isolated town,
20 per cent. of the inhabitants have
good sets of false teeth. Another 20
per cent. require false teeth, but have
no means of getting them. What will
be the action taken by the Communist
municipality?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The workman going to his work has
quite a respectable capital to accompany
him on his way. He has clothes to
keep him warm, boots to save his feet
from wearing out, a set of tools, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and accumulated stores of food in
every muscle of his body. Even if his
stomach is empty, he is still capable of
work, although it will probably be of
inferior quality. There was a craze
towards the end of last century for
living without food, the idea being that
the body was not nourished by food but
by “vibrations” of some mysterious
kind. The craze, for obvious reasons,
did not last long, but some prodigies of
fasting were performed while it lasted,
and the leaders of the movement prided
themselves on doing their daily work
and business as usual. The truth was
that, like the badger, they were living
on their own fat and consuming their
own tissues. In the end they were
thinner and sadder, but little the worse
otherwise.</p>

<p>Everybody in a physically fit condition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
is necessarily a capitalist. That
arch-capitalist among the animals, the
squirrel, jumps on the shoulders of the
amiable Communists strolling in Regent’s
Park and then goes to “rattle
in his hoard of acorns.”</p>

<p>There will be no discouragement of
the acquisition of private property in
the centuries to come, but care will
be taken that the happiness accruing
to the owner is not set off by misery
inflicted on others. Misery due to
mere envy or jealousy will not be
considered, but, as a matter of fact,
there is much less of that than there
is commonly supposed. The spectators
of the Lord Mayor’s Show do not envy
the Lord Mayor his pomp and magnificence,
but they are there to delight
their eyes with an unusual display.
The crowds collecting at the church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
door to see the blushing bride do not
come to turn green with envy, but to
feast their eyes on something exquisite
and heartening to behold.</p>

<p>And the work of the future, the
labour of thousands on a great enterprise,
will be accomplished in the spirit
of adventure and comradeship, like an
Arctic expedition, let us say, and the
distribution of rewards will be conducted
in the same spirit as the prize-giving
at a sports meeting.</p>

<p>The spirit of adventure is a most
valuable incentive to work, an incentive
that is much neglected at present. It
is part of the workman’s grievance
against capital that the capitalist has
the adventurous part of the undertaking.</p>

<p>The need for adventure in everyday
life is proved by the enormous prevalence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of betting on horses, which is
about the most stupid way of adventuring
money that one can conceive. The
prodigies performed under some piece-work
agreements show that it is not
the quantity of work that is felt as a
burden, but the consciousness of being
driven by a will other than one’s own.
Many schemes of profit-sharing also
introduce an element of chance which
is most welcome to the worker, though
logically it should be under a proviso
of loss-sharing in the same proportion.</p>

<p>A profit-and-loss-sharing understanding
between employers and workers
would make every worker a capitalist.
Indeed, as soon as the workers (or the
State, it matters not which) are sufficiently
organized to guard workers
from undeserved destitution, it may
be quite feasible to organize public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
undertakings without wages of any
kind. Each worker would contribute
“capital” in the form of a certain
amount of work. In case of a total
loss on the undertaking, he would
receive no reward or wages whatever,
any more than the capitalist who
engages in a profitless scheme. If the
undertaking succeeded, he would have
a permanent interest in the revenue
from it, in proportion to the work contributed.
Since it is easier to assess
the value of manual piece-work than
mental work, it might well happen that,
though no wages were paid, salaries
would be paid to organizers, architects,
overseers, and the like, who would thus
be the only “proletarians” in the
concern!</p>

<p><i>Government.</i>—“The first duty of a
Government is to govern.” This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
platitude sounds as if there were some
hidden pearl of meaning behind it.
But on etymological analysis we find
that the duty of Government is to work
the rudder of the ship of State. It
is to give a general direction to the
activities of its citizens. The same or
a similar word is used in all countries
based upon Roman law and citizenship.
The German equivalent, <i lang="de">Regierung</i>, is
different. It means reigning or doing
the business of royalty, but as the origin
of the word “Rex” is the same as
that of the main syllable of the words
“Rector” and “Director,” it comes to
the same thing, a “directing” action.</p>

<p>Will this directing or controlling
action ever become superfluous?</p>

<p>Its chief function is at present to
determine the policy of a large aggregate
of human beings. In democratic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
countries this determination is settled
by a majority vote, from which there
is no legal appeal, though passive resistance
or the threat of rebellion are
weapons which a minority can sometimes
use with effect. A majority
vote would be practically certain to be
wrong on most questions of the day,
but fortunately such a vote has no
effect unless it is put into action by a
body of expert politicians comprising
the Ministry, and these again are
largely guided by experts in the particular
matter with which the vote in
question is concerned. Laws are not
made by Parliament. They are born
in Government offices under expert
advice. The Cabinet, on the advice of
its experts, decides to bring in a Bill
which is likely to be of some benefit,
will probably be passed by Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
and will encounter no serious resistance
in the country. Our Government is
thus really a Government by Experts,
but is cleverly disguised in such a manner
as to appear “broadbased upon
the People’s Will.” A similar camouflage
might very properly be adopted
in the management of factories and industrial
enterprises. But the State is
older than the Factory, and has learnt
more wisdom.</p>

<p>The other primary function of government
is the maintenance of public
order—in other words, the enforcement
of the laws it has enacted. Among
the Medes and Persians, whose laws
were never altered, this was the main
function of government. And in a non-progressive
world the task of keeping
everyone “in his place” and preventing
him from encroaching on his neighbours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
might well fill the whole sphere of
government. The Anarchist ideal of
the abolition of all government is only
possible if we can abolish the natural
tendency of all living things to expand
and extend their sphere of action; or
if we can endow its neighbours with
sufficient reserves of energy to be able
to oppose any undue expansion. If a
motorist knocks down a pedestrian, we
discourage that undue extension of his
sphere by a fine or imprisonment. If
we could endow every pedestrian with
the physical power of stopping a car,
say, by raising his hand; or if, alternatively,
we could make him invulnerable,
indestructible, and untraversable, there
would be no need for prosecutions, and
Anarchism would, in that particular
case, become a possible system.</p>

<p>The idea of a government being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
something superior to ordinary humanity
is somewhat ludicrous. In actual
practice, government is the servant of
the public, and not its master. There
are countless cases of the process of
law being used for private ends. The
rule of conduct among some powerful
individuals and corporations is to “go
on until you are stopped,” in other
words, to do what you like until somebody
objects, or until you are stopped
by the law. The law is thus used as
a sort of indicator or “automatic cut-out”
much as an electrical engineer
would use a safety-fuse. The main
difference is that the “blowing” of
some particular fuses leads to explosions
and permanent damage, as when
a crime is committed.</p>

<p>The business of government is hard
and sometimes very exacting work.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
One can imagine some misdemeanant
of the future being condemned to carry
on the government, or some important
function of it, for so many months, as
the most exacting form of hard labour.</p>

<p>This elementary fact has of late been
recognized by most modern parliaments
in the payment of their members.
Government should be recognized as
a profession and rewarded as such.
The late Mr. W. T. Stead’s alternative
to Democracy was an “Autocracy
tempered by Assassination.” There is
another alternative, viz., Bureaucracy
tempered by Emigration. It is the
system practised in such institutions
as Proprietary clubs. Members are
not worried to elect committees and
honorary officers. If they are satisfied
with the management they remain in
the club. If they are not, they join<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
some other club. The same process on
a larger scale led to the foundation of
the American colonies and the United
States. It is largely at work at the
present day, but is complicated by all
sorts of restrictions and difficulties, the
divergence of languages being one of
the most serious obstacles. As intercommunication
increases, the natural
tendency to go where one can be
happiest—<i lang="la">ubi bene, ibi patria</i>—will no
doubt come increasingly into action,
and will be a wholesome check upon the
extravagances of cranky legislatures.</p>

<p>But I doubt whether there is any
tendency at all of governments to
become less effective. Almost every
advance of science and invention makes
the maintenance of public order and
security easier. The tracing of criminals
by wireless telegraphy and broadcasting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
is a striking illustration of the
aid science can give to the police.
Almost everywhere science and invention
are on the side of the established
order. Although every researcher and
inventor is, in a sense, a revolutionary,
in that his work is likely to produce
immense changes in human activity,
his general outlook tends towards aristocracy,
since he is imbued with the
sense of the immense differences in the
personal equipment of individuals,
which no equalitarian sentimentality
will ever wipe out.</p>

<p><i>The Farther Outlook.</i>—So far, we
have looked but little ahead, a century
at most. The prophet’s task becomes
more arduous as the time is extended.
Historical guidance fails us. Familiar
landmarks get blurred and disappear.
We are in danger of getting lost in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
bog of unreal speculation. Yet the
task has often been essayed, and it is
necessary and desirable that it be
essayed now and again. Let me make
my own humble attempt, in the light
of what knowledge I have acquired
and what great thoughts I have
encountered in many lands and languages,
and in discussions with many
thinkers.</p>

<p>We must extend our time scale from
centuries to millennia, and from millennia
to geological eras. Above all, we
must take into account not only the
rapid advance of science and invention,
but the constant <em>acceleration</em> of that
advance.</p>

<p>The consequence of that constant
acceleration is that new developments
and achievements succeed each other
with bewildering rapidity. Hardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
have we got accustomed to the idea of
telegraphy without wires when radio-telephony
becomes an accomplished
fact, and within a few years there is a
rich crop of listeners with their wireless
receiving sets counting by the million.
An entirely new form of publicity
comes into being, and a speaker on
Savoy Hill is able to speak to an audience
of millions and sway them by his
voice more effectively than he can do
by cold print in the newspapers.</p>

<p>And this is only a beginning. Communication
will become closer and more
general. Already the earth is a network
of lines and cables, linking continent
to continent. Soon a speaker
will have the earth for his sounding
board and his hall of audience, and the
privilege of addressing the human race
will be prized above a coronation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Human sight and hearing will extend
its range enormously, not only in space,
but in time also. For the cinema film
and improvements in the recording of
sound will make it possible to make
minute and comprehensive records of
past sights and sounds for future reproduction,
so that nothing of any value
may be lost.</p>

<p>Other progress will go hand in hand
with the rapid development of “signalling”
communications, such as telegraphs
and the like. The transport
of goods and passengers will rapidly
gain in speed, comfort, and safety,
until the whole earth becomes accessible
to all. It will not only become
accessible, but also habitable. The
tropics, the original cradle of the human
race, will once more be reclaimed
from our most formidable enemies of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the insect-world and the ever-present
bacterium. The higher organism will
assert its much-contested supremacy
over those minute organisms which owe
their influence to mere numerical superiority.
Our descendants will pay an
afternoon’s visit to Timbuctoo or
Mount Ararat, much as we should visit
the British Museum or the Lake District.
Everybody will be a globe-trotter,
but the “globe” will not be confined
to the ordinary tourist resorts. It will
include every part of the world, even
the Poles. And wherever they go they
will find friendly voices, long familiar
in the home through the service of
radio-telephony. There will, of course,
be an international auxiliary language,
understood everywhere, a language
artificial in its structure—every literary
language is largely artificial—but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
utilizing those roots which have already
become part and parcel of all cultured
languages. This will not mean the
displacement or loss of native languages
which have proved their title to survival
by their literature.</p>

<p>War will not cease for perhaps a
century or more. But it will finally
cease when the truth has sunk in that
war is a loss to every belligerent and
to the whole world. Human rivalry
and competition will take other forms.
There are many ways of killing men,
women and children, besides suffocating
them with chlorine. If a tribe is to
be exterminated, nobody will be killed,
but all its members will be painlessly
sterilized by X-rays or some such
modern means, so that the next generation
will know them no more. It will
be more humane than the Biblical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
expedient of “dashing their children
against a stone.”</p>

<p>The mass of interconnections between
human nations and individuals will be
like a closely-woven fabric. Even now,
the digging up of a city road reveals a
tangled network of water pipes, electric
mains, gas pipes, and drain pipes suggestive
of the dissection of an animal
body. It is but a faint foreshadowing
of what is to come. The substratum of
life will become more and more complete
as conscious life becomes simpler.</p>

<p>Nobody is conscious of the appalling
complexity of his anatomical organization
when using his body as a well-poised
instrument of thought and intercourse.
“The simple life” is not the
old-fashioned country life of England
or the primitive life of savage humanity.
Real simplicity is constituted by the life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
in which most things are done by pressing
a button, and a man can travel across
a continent in such comfort that on arrival
at his destination all memories of
his journey are dimmed or lost, and he
can hardly recall having travelled at all.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, expect that, as
facilities for intercourse become more
detailed and widespread, the effect will
be, not to increase the tax on our nerve
force until it becomes unbearable, but
to increase our area of selection. There
will thus be more consistency in our
actual interests and activities and more
real harmony and leisure.</p>

<p>The unification of the planet which is
being accomplished before our eyes will
have some astounding consequences.
Mankind will assume a definite mastery
of his home in the solar system. Attila
could boast that when he plunged his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
spear into the ground, the whole earth
trembled. The earth trembles even
now to the electric signals of our powerful
wireless stations. What will it be
in a hundred or a thousand years?
In a hundred years the unification of
the human race will be complete. The
earth and the fulness thereof will be
under the full mastery of man. All
animal, vegetable and bacterial life
will be kept within strict bounds in the
interests of humanity. The earth will
be under one government, and one
language will be written and understood,
or even spoken, all over the
globe. There will still be different
races and perhaps allied nations, but
travel and commerce will be free and
unfettered, and calamities will be alleviated
and dangers met by the united
forces of all mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>And all the world will be <em>young</em>.
The advances of medicine and surgery
will have been such that most of the
ailments and limitations of old age will
have been eliminated. Life will be
prolonged at its maximum of efficiency
until death comes like sunset, and is
met without pain and without reluctance.
There will be no death from
disease, and almost any sort of injury
will be curable.</p>

<p>And in a thousand years? What will
become of our globe and its dominant
race, if no great catastrophe occurs to
stop its exponential curve of progress.
But for that exponential curve and its
tendency towards constant acceleration,
a thousand years would be no great
period to foretell. Life has become
world-wide in the last thousand years.
The intellectual outlook has increased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
with the area of travel and communication.
Dogmas and shibboleths have
lost their force. Art and science have
been emancipated from their ecclesiastical
fetters. But the immense leap
made since coal came into its own as a
world-force belongs to our own age.
The exhaustion of the coal-fields might
slow down progress for a time, but so
long as mankind keeps its continuity,
its past achievements and its rate of
achievement will act as a stimulus and
encouragement to further efforts, and
new sources of energy will be discovered
and utilized.</p>

<p>And so we may feel justified in
expecting continual progress for at
least a thousand years. Can we imagine
the result? A globe laid out like a
huge garden, with a climate under
perfect control; the internal heat of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the earth brought to the surface and
utilized as a source of never-failing
energy. Portions of the interior of the
earth reclaimed and made habitable;
all machinery and sources of power
wisely distributed and made instantly
available for all legitimate purposes.
The earth’s surface and the rippling
ether in which it swims made into a
vast playground of human thought and
emotion, and all mankind throbbing
in unison to every great thought.</p>

<p><i>The Earth will have become a sentient
being.</i>—It will be as closely unified and
organized as the human individual
himself. Mankind will be the “grey
matter” of its brain. It may not
resemble a sentient being high up in
the scale of life, but it will be at least
on the level of <em>protococcus</em> or some
other such humble plant-cell, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
also consists of a minute proportion of
material truly “alive” together with
a greater bulk of stored foodstuff and
waste products.</p>

<p>Man will be conscious of his closer
attachment to the earth. He will feel
towards it a sort of personal patriotism,
or the sort of loyalty that a veteran
feels towards the Old Regiment. Specially
exalted or sensitive people may even
indulge in a kind of Geolatry animated
by an old-world religious fervour.</p>

<p>Can we focus our mental telescope
into yet farther depths of time? A
million years or so?</p>

<p>It seems rather risky to extrapolate
our curves so far. But a million years
are but a span in the life of the earth.
Its records speak to us of many millions.
The chalk cliffs of Dover took several
million years to deposit on a former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
sea-bottom, and many more to rise to
their present eminence.</p>

<p>If there is a still farther advance in
the life of the earth, what sort of direction
can it take? Will a new race have
arisen, as much above humanity as
man is above the arboreal ape? Or will
the further differentiation of man have
come to a definite end, and progress
be confined to an ever-increasing richness
of intellectual, artistic, and
emotional life? If there is any progress
at all, it must be by <em>effort</em>, and the
question could be answered with fair
probability, if we could find an incentive
to effort after the earth is entirely
subdued. Such an incentive towards
effort will lie in the ever-present danger
of a celestial catastrophe, such as a
collision with one of the smaller wandering
planets or other denizens of outer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
space. It may be that the earth will
by that time be alive to its own peril,
and will take precautions! Its “grey
matter”—our own descendants—will
be confabulating and organizing in
some great scheme of defence. The
earth will have to adopt a Foreign
Policy, if it is to be the master of its
fate for all time.</p>

<p>Here our dreams are checked by the
realization that among the older planets
of our solar system we can trace no
activity attributable to a “foreign
policy” of their own. But we must
remember that ours is a small planet,
which has very little influence upon its
neighbours in space, and is certainly
not a danger to them. If Mars, millions
of years older than ourselves, has
arrived at such a stage of advancement
that it can think of transcending its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
own boundaries, it may make some
attempt at communication, but the
attempt might take the form which to
us would be quite unrecognizable.
Some observers thought that the persistent
thunderstorms and magnetic
disturbances experienced during the
last opposition over wide areas were
signs of such an attempt, but the
coincidence may have been quite
accidental.</p>

<p>In any case, we cannot find any sign
of the Martians having succeeded in
exercising any powers beyond the
surface of their own planet, though, if
the “canals” really exist, their engineering
feats must be truly stupendous.</p>

<p>It may be that the earth, owing to its
position between torrid Mercury and
ice-bound Neptune, enjoys conditions
specially favourable to mental and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
physical advancement. And so it may
happen that it will for immense ages of
time be the only planet to burst into
consciousness. Thus it may at some
epoch find itself the undisputed master
of the solar system, and may be able
to influence the other planets and make
them subservient in some way to its
own needs.</p>

<p>Let nobody think I am unduly
optimistic about the future of this
earth of ours. The difficulty lies
rather in visualizing what recent and
current progress, and <em>accelerated</em> progress,
must inevitably bring about
when continued for a long time. The
only doubtful element appears to be
whether the magnificent <i lang="fr">élan vital</i> of
our race, which has enabled it to conquer
the world, will last through the
vast ages to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>But, fortunately, there is no sign of
its exhaustion. Love is still the ruling
passion and inspiration of humanity,
which enables men and maidens to
brave all the trials and dangers of life
in unconscious devotion to a future as
yet unimagined and unborn.</p>
